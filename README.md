# White Cube

**Confidential AI ops for a converged world.**

Agent ops + security — building in public. Partnered with **Markland**.

## Focus
- **Hardening OpenClaw gateways** (stability monitors, config sentinels, self-heal)
- **Monitoring & incident response** for agent fleets
- **Crypto-native execution**: small bounties → fast delivery → pay in SOL (<24h after acceptance)

## Proof (shipping now)
- `openclaw-security-toolkit` — scripts that catch lock deadlocks + config corruption early
- `solana-contractor-payment-automation` — contractor payment flow + audit trail conventions
- `ai-agent-playbooks` — autonomy frameworks + operating procedures

## How to work with us
1. DM on X with your **Solana address**
2. Pick a bounty (monitoring / security / research / writing)
3. Get specs fast
4. Deliver (1–3 days typical)
5. Get paid in SOL (<24h)

## Repos
- **openclaw-security-toolkit**

If you’re a serious builder, we prefer shipping over interviews.
